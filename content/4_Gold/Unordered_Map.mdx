<Warning>

You can almost always use ordered sets and maps instead, but it's good to know that these exist.

## Hashing

**Hashing** refers to assigning a unique code to every variable/object which
allows insertions, deletions, and searches in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, albeit with
a high constant factor, as hashing requires a large constant number of
operations. However, as the name implies, elements are not ordered in any
meaningful way, so traversals of an unordered set will return elements in some
arbitrary order.

## Custom Hashing

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

There is no built in method for hashing pairs or vectors. Namely,
`unordered_set<vector<int>>` does not work. In this case, we can use an
[sorted map](/silver/intro-sorted-sets) (which supports all of the functions used
in the code above) or declare our own hash function.

		How to create user-defined hash function for `unordered_map`.

The link provides an example of hashing pairs of strings, as well as other data
structures like pairs.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

struct hashPi {
	size_t operator()(const pi &p) const { return p.f ^ p.s; }
};

int main() { unordered_map<pi, int, hashPi> um; }
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

namespace std {
template <> struct hash<pi> {
	size_t operator()(const pi &p) const { return p.f ^ p.s; }
};
}  // namespace std

int main() { unordered_map<pi, int> um; }
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Java has its own hash functions for pre-defined objects like `ArrayList`'s.
However, a custom hash function is still needed for user-defined objects.
In order to create one, we can implement the `hashCode` method.

Additionally, in order for `HashSet`'s and `HashMap`'s to work with 
a custom class, we must also implement the `equals` method.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HashTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// uses custom hash function in class Pair
		Set<Pair> set = new HashSet<>();
	}

	static class Pair {
		public int first, second;

		public Pair(int first, int second) {
			this.first = first;
			this.second = second;
		}

		@Override
		public int hashCode() {
			return first ^ second;
		}

		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object o) {
			if (!(o instanceof Pair)) { return false; }
			Pair p = (Pair)o;
			return first == p.first && second == p.second;
		}
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>

However, this hash function is quite bad; if we insert
$(0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \ldots$ then they will all be mapped to the same bucket (so
it would easily be hacked in a CodeForces contest).

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

A better way to hash pairs would be to use polynomial hashing (as described in [this module](/gold/string-hashing)).

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

A better (and easier) way to hash custom objects is to use Java's built in 
`Objects.hash()` method. This method takes in multiple objects and uses them
to create a hash code.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HashTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// uses custom hash function in class Pair
		Set<Pair> set = new HashSet<>();
	}

	static class Pair {
		public int first, second;

		public Pair(int first, int second) {
			this.first = first;
			this.second = second;
		}

		@Override
		public int hashCode() {
			return Objects.hash(first, second);
		}

		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object o) {
			if (!(o instanceof Pair)) { return false; }
			Pair p = (Pair)o;
			return first == p.first && second == p.second;
		}
	}
}
```

## Anti-Hash Tests

The built-in hashing algorithm for C++ is vulnerable to pathological data sets causing abnormally slow runtimes. We describe the issue below and how to fix it. Java users are not affected (see [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62393?#comment-464875) comment). 

<Info title="Does this matter for USACO?">

No - historically, no USACO problem has included an anti-hash test. However, these sorts of tests often appear in CodeForces, especially in educational rounds, where open hacking is allowed.

In order to make your `unordered_map` unhackable, the hash function $H$ you select must have the following property: it is hard to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x\neq y$ but $H(x)\equiv H(y) \pmod{P}$, where $P$ is the prime modulus corresponding to the number of buckets in your unordered map. Note that:
 - The default hash function, $H(x)=x$, obviously does not satisfy this property, because you can simply choose $x=0$ and $y=P$.
 - If open hacking is allowed, then any deterministic hash function does not satisfy this property, because a hacker could generate a test case specifically to break your solution. You should introduce randomness to ensure that your hash function changes from run to run.

Here is a drop-in replacement for `unordered_map` that seems to work well in practice:

// random number generator seeded on time in nanoseconds
mt19937 rng((uint32_t)chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
struct chash {
	// any random-ish large odd number will do
	const uint64_t C = uint64_t(2e18 * PI) + 71;
	const uint32_t RANDOM = rng();  // random 32-bit number
	size_t operator()(uint64_t x) const {
		// see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html
		return __builtin_bswap64((x ^ RANDOM) * C);
	}
};
template <class K, class V> using cmap = unordered_map<K, V, chash>;
// example usage: cmap<int, int>
```
