## Explanation

After Elsie has made all the modifications to the log array $A$, the log will
show that Bessie sleeps the same number of hours every day. Let's call that
number $\texttt{num\_hours}$.

Since the total number of hours won't change, we can call that number
$\texttt{sum}$.

Therefore, the length of the modified log will be
$\texttt{sum}/\texttt{num\_hours}$. Since every modification reduces the length
of the log by 1, the number of modifications will be
$N-\texttt{sum}/\texttt{num\_hours}$.

$N$ and $\texttt{sum}$ are constant, so, to minimize $N-\texttt{sum}/\texttt{num\_hours}$, 
we need to minimize $\texttt{num\_hours}$ too.

In order to do that, we iterate over possible values of $\texttt{num\_hours}$ and
check if it's valid. If it is, then we print out the answer
$N-\texttt{sum}/\texttt{num\_hours}$ and terminate the program.

We iterate over $A$ from left to right and combine values to test if a value 
of $\texttt{num\_hours}$ is valid. If at some point a combined value exceeds 
$\texttt{num\_hours}$ then we know that $\texttt{num\_hours}$ is not
valid.  

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:**
$\mathcal{O}(N \cdot (\# \, \text{divisors of } \texttt{sum}))$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> A;

/** @return if num_hours leads to a valid answer */
bool check(int num_hours) {
	int curr_sum = 0;  // keeps track of the current sum
	// iterate over the vector
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		curr_sum += A[i];
		if (curr_sum > num_hours) {
			return false;  // currsum cannot exceed x
		} else if (curr_sum == num_hours) {
			curr_sum = 0;  // reset currsum
		}
	}
	return true;
}

int main() {
	int T;
	cin >> T;
	for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
		cin >> N;
		A = vector<int>(N);
		int sum = 0;  
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			cin >> A[i];
			sum += A[i];
		}

		/*
		 * num_hours is the # of hours of sleep every class AFTER modification
		 * iterate over num_hours from small to large
		 * because the smallest possible num_hours is optimal
		 */
		for (int num_hours = 0; num_hours <= sum; num_hours++) {
			if (num_hours != 0 && sum % num_hours != 0) {
				// sum must be divisible by num_hours
				continue;
			}
			if (check(num_hours)) {
				if (num_hours == 0) {
					// special case because you can't divide by 0
					cout << 0 << endl;
				} else {
					/*
					 * sum/num_hours is the total # of classes AFTER
					 * modification therefore N-sum/num_hours would be the # of
					 * modifications needed
					 */
					cout << N - sum / num_hours << endl;
				}
				
				/*
				 * there's no point trying bigger values of num_hours,
				 * so we break and go to solve the next test case
				 */
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
