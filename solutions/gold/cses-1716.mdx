## Explanation

To get a more illustrative idea of the given problem, consider $n + m - 1$ white
balls in a row. Of those $n + m - 1$ white balls, $m - 1$ are chosen to be
colored black as separators, which gives us exactly $m$ segments of (possibly
zero) white balls. There are 

$$
\binom{n + m - 1}{m - 1}
$$

ways to choose the balls to color black. 

The ways to color $m - 1$ balls black corresponds to the ways to distribute
those $n$ apples to $m$ children, since the number of white balls in a segment
corresponds to the number of apples given to a child.

<Optional> 

The given problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions for the
equation

$$
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = m.
$$

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
