## Explanation

The problem asks for the minimum amount of distance the cows need to travel for a circular barn. However, if we fix the position of the first door, the problem can be reduced to a linear barn, starting with the position of the first door. In such case, we can define $dp[i][j]$ as the sum of distance to fill the rooms $[j, n]$ if we place the $i$-th door at $j$. $dp[0][n+1]$ is equal $0$ since with no doors the only case where the distance is zero is  Our transitions would be then:
