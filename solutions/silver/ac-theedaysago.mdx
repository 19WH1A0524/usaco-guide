## Explanation

A string is happy if and only if the number of each digit in the string is
divisible by 2. Let's represent this information using an integer $i$ and call
it the state of a substring. The $k$-th bit of $i$ is 1 if the digit $k$
occurred odd times in the string, and 0 otherwise.

We go through all substrings $[0, j]$ for all $j \leq |S|$ and use a map
$\text{states}$ to count how many times a state occurs in those substrings. Any
substring $[l, r]$ is happy if the states of $[0, l - 1]$ and $[0, r]$ are
identical. 

To count the number of all happy substrings, we just have to consider all
states. For each state that occurred $x$ times, there are $\frac{x(x-1)}{2}$
ways to map any two of them $[0, j_1]$ and $[0, j_2]$ to get a happy substring
$[j_1 - 1, j_2]$. The total number of all happy substrings is then
$\sum_i^{2^{10}} \frac{\text{states}[i] \cdot (\text{states}[i] - 1)}{2}$. 


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(|S| + 2^D)$, where $D = 10$ is the number of
possible digits in the string.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	string S;
	cin >> S;

	// the current state
	int cur_state = 0;
	// states[i] := # of occurrences of state i in the substrings [0, j]
	map<int, ll> states;
	states[cur_state]++;

	for (const char &digit : S) {
		// update the parity of the current digit
		cur_state ^= 1 << (digit - '0');
		// update the counter for the state
		states[cur_state]++;
	}

	ll ans = 0;
	for (auto &[_, ct] : states) {
		ans += ct * (ct - 1) / 2;
	}

	cout << ans << endl;
}
