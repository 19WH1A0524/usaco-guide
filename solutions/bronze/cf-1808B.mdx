## Explanation

Essentially, the solution is to calculate the difference between the sum of the larger elements and the sum of the smaller
elements in each column, and weighting this difference by the number of times that the smaller element appears in that column.
This is based on the observation that if we have n numbers, and we want to minimize the sum of absolute differences between
each number and some target value, then the target value should be the median of those n numbers. This solution applies this
observation to each column of the matrix, separately.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2 M)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
		int n, m;
		cin >> n >> m;
		vector<vector<int>> a(n, vector<int>(m));
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) { cin >> a[i][j]; }
		}

		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			vector<int> temp;
			int sum = 0.0;
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				temp.push_back(a[j][i]);
				sum += a[j][i];
			}
			int curr = 0;
			sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				curr += temp[j];
				ans += abs((sum - curr) - (n - 1 - j) * temp[j]);
			}
		}

		cout << fixed << ans << "\n";
	}
}
```
